## Ugly number
Question: Ugly numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. The sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, … shows the first 11 ugly numbers. By convention, 1 is included.

Answer: 
Here is a time efficient solution with O(n) extra space. The ugly-number sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, …
     because every number can only be divided by 2, 3, 5, one way to look at the sequence is to split the sequence to three groups as below:
     (1) 1×2, 2×2, 3×2, 4×2, 5×2, …
     (2) 1×3, 2×3, 3×3, 4×3, 5×3, …
     (3) 1×5, 2×5, 3×5, 4×5, 5×5, …
